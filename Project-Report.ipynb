    "**Welcome to the project report for our python group project!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with the reading of this report, ensure that you have read the contents of the `README.md` file, which gives all the relevant background information and instructions for the running and implementation of the code. For any additional questions in that regard, please use one of the appropriate contact channels mentioned in the `README.md` file. We thank you for your cooperation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for this project materialized upon the realization that the python code submitted by students were manually correct, sheet by sheet, by the teachers of the course. This was especially enduring due to the fact that it was a beginners course, meaning a lot more effort compared to other courses. For this reason, it felt intuitive to at least not have to endure the additional step of going through the content that could already be confirmed to be correct. The goal of this project was to make the correction process lighter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Working\n",
    "\n",
    "The code functions in three main steps and one cleanup step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Organisation**: This step involved identifying the folder structure, looking for the relevant exercise sheets as zip files, unzipping them, identifying the exercises in there, and setting them up for correction/grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Grading/Correcting**: This involved the actual work on the exercise sheets. Mainly conducting specific checks based on the details of the task. The checking stemmed down to a `statement`. When it was `True`, the exercise passed, and when it was `False`, the exercise failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Grading and sorting**: This was the final step before cleanup, where, based on whether the exercise sheet passed or failed (whether `statement` was `True` or `False`, the points are inputted into a `Points_Log.txt` and the exercise sheet moves to a folder, named based on whether it is successful or unsuccessful). If it was unsucessful, it moves to a folder for manual correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cleanup**: It deleted typically remaining folders like `__MACOSX` (remnants from extracting zip files zipped with Apple&trade; ) and `__pycache__` (containing pre-compiled data to make it easier for IDE's to run the code. We will not need it for the correction, so we also delete it). It then scans for files that the system could not recognize as an exercise sheet, and moves it to a seperate folder for `Unrecognized sheets`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ground code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function: select_parent_folder()\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of the entire process is to collect a mother directory. This is the directory which will contain several child folders with exercise sheets in them. The code for it was simple, and just used the tkinter `filedialog` function built exactly for this purpose:\n"

    "\n",
    "Now comes the part where the function lives upto its name! The extraction. Before extracting, it first checks to see if the exercise sheet in question has already been extracted. If yes, then it will simply skip the extraction and move on. Apart from that, Another problem that we faced was that some students were naming their zip files with the \".zip\" inside their names. So, for example the file would be `sheet01.zip.zip`. If this was extracted, it would extract it to a folder called `sheet01.zip` (even though it is not a zip file and is simpply a directory with .zip in its name). The `os` library cannot tell the difference between a zip file called `sheet01.zip` and a directory called `sheet01.zip` and therefore throws an error saying that two files with the same name cannot exist in the same directory. For that reason, we put the extraction in a try block, and in the event of an error (`FileNotFoundError`for Windows `NotADirectoryError` for mac), we added a few extra steps that fixed this naming problem:"
